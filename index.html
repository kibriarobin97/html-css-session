        <h3>About Laptop Computer</h3>
        <p>A laptop computer or notebook computer, also known as a laptop or notebook for short, is a small, portable
            personal computer (PC). Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with a flat panel screen (usually
            11–17 in or 280–430 mm in diagonal size) on the inside of the upper lid and an alphanumeric keyboard and
            pointing device (such as a trackpad and/or trackpoint) on the inside of the lower lid, although 2-in-1 PCs
            with a detachable keyboard are often marketed as laptops or as having a <span class="special">"laptop mode"</span>.[1][2] Most of the
            computer's internal hardware is fitted inside the lower lid enclosure under the keyboard, although many
            laptops have a built-in webcam at the top of the screen and some modern ones even feature a touch-screen
            display. In most cases, unlike tablet computers which run on mobile operating systems, laptops tend to run
            on desktop operating systems which have been traditionally associated with desktop computers.</p>
